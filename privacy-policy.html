                    <li>Session duration and frequency</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Push Notification Token:</strong> Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) registration token for delivering push notifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymized usage statistics to improve the App experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Firebase Crashlytics automatically collects crash and error data to help us identify and fix issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> To create and manage your account, deliver messages, and enable core App functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> To personalize your experience and adapt notification frequency based on your engagement patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> To send you notifications when you receive messages or replies (with your permission).</li>
            <li><strong>Content Moderation:</strong> To enforce our content policies, particularly in Shine Mode, using automated moderation tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics and Improvements:</strong> To understand how users interact with the App, identify bugs, and improve features.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety and Security:</strong> To detect, prevent, and address fraud, abuse, security issues, and technical problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To respond to your inquiries, send important updates, and provide customer support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Content Filtering and Moderation</h2>

        <p>Madafaker offers two distinct content filtering modes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shine Mode:</strong> Messages are filtered using OpenAI's Moderation API and Firebase ML Kit to remove abuse, hate speech, harassment, profanity, and other harmful content to maintain a positive environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Shadow Mode:</strong> Light filtering that only removes illegal content (drug trafficking, exploitation of minors, explicit violence) while allowing more controversial expression.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Message content may be processed by these third-party moderation services to enforce our content policies. No moderation service is perfect, and we reserve the right to manually review flagged content when necessary.</p>

        <h2>4. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Public Information</h3>
        <p>The following information is visible to other users of the App:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your chosen nickname</li>
            <li>Messages you send (randomly distributed to active users)</li>
            <li>Public replies you create (if marked as public)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
        <p>We share information with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating the App:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Content moderation for Shine Mode messages.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These service providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes we specify.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., court orders, subpoenas, or government requests).</p>

        <h3>4.4 Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will provide notice before your information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

        <h3>4.5 We Do Not Sell Your Data</h3>

            <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Retained for 90 days in Firebase Crashlytics.</li>
        </ul>
